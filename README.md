## A 'Dummy' File Generator


</div>

### Description

generates a 'dummy' file which can be any type and any number of kilobytes. 110% commented just like my code 'A+ Secure Delete'. purpose is to generate files, so not much of a purpose. i just saw it in a couple of hacking/security programs and thought i'd try it.

```
Function GenerateDummyFile(Path As String, LengthInKB As Long)
'This function is used to Generate A "Dummy File"
'(it's a file that's only purpose is to do absolutely
'nothing).
On Error Resume Next 'If we get an error, keep going
Dim GeneratedByte As Byte, Generate As Integer 'the variables
Open Path For Binary Access Write As #1 'Open the "Dummy Path" so we can write to it
For Generate = 1 To LengthInKB * 1024 'this is the loop to that does 2 things...
'1) goes from 1 to the length in KiloBytes (to add to the file)
'2) converts bytes to KiloBytes By Multiplying The Size in KB * 1024 (the size of on KB in bytes)
  Put #1, , GeneratedByte 'put the generated byte into the "Dummy File"
Next Generate 'stop the loop
MsgBox "Done!"
End Function
